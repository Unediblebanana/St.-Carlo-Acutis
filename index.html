<h3><b>"The more Eucharist we receive, the more we will become like Jesus, so that on earth we will have a foretaste of Heaven" - Carlo Acutis</b></h3>
    <p>Carlo Acutis was born on May 3, 1991 in London. Throughout his early life, Carlo had many memorable instances of love and grace with others. Although they were Catholic, Carlo’s parents didn’t practice their faith. Carlo was not yet four when he asked his mother questions about their faith, and he received many of his answers from his devout Polish nanny.</p>

<p>During most of his youth, Carlo was cared for by nannies, as his parents worked in family businesses. Occasionally, however, Carlo would visit daycare centers. On one of these visits, he was bullied by another child. When his nanny told him he should set boundaries so that the bully would not take his toys, Carlo responded that “Jesus would not be happy if I lost my temper.”</p>

<p>Carlo was an ordinary boy who enjoyed the same games that we still enjoy today, like Halo, Mario, and Pokemon, and even owned a Playstation. Knowing that these games would quickly distract him from his true purpose, Carlo limited himself to just one hour of gaming each week despite wanting to play more. </p>

<p>Carlo’s evangelizing spirit wasn't just shown in one particular action or moment, but through an entire lifetime. Carlo wasn’t content with speaking about his faith only to those he knew already shared it. Instead, he spoke boldly about Jesus even to those of a completely different religion, evangelizing them by showing the love and joy that comes with Jesus. Carlo’s family employed an immigrant from Mauritius named Rajesh Mojur to work in their household. After speaking to Carlo for some time about his faith, Mojur asked to be baptized. Soon later, a friend of Mohur’s talked with Carlo and also asked to be baptized, as well as Mohur’s mother who visited from Mauritius and had attended Mass with Carlo and her son. Carlo simply couldn’t go without sharing his faith to those around him. He knew how essential it was for his life to know Jesus and to have a real relationship with Him, and wanted others to experience this joy as well.</p> 

<p>When Carlo was 12, he became a catechist for his parish, where it was customary for young team leaders to deliver religious education to their peers. Then, utilizing the computer science skills he had been honing for years, he created three websites. The first was a website for his parish, the second was a website promoting volunteering for his high school, and the third was an extensive and beatiful website dedicated to cataloguing every reported Eucharistic miracle in the world and maintaining a list of approved Marian apparitions. This last website, <a href="https://www.miracolieucaristici.org/en/liste/list.html" title="Miracoli Eucaristici" target="_blank" class="w3-hover-opacity">linked here</a>, is a culmination of the love that Carlo showed the Eucharist throughout his life, having received his First Communion early at 7 years old, spending a Holy Hour at Eucharistic Adoration 2-3 times per week, and dragging his parents to Mass with him daily, where he received the body and blood of Jesus. </p>

<p>On October 1, 2006, Carlo grew sick, with the first symptom being an inflamed throat. By October 8th, he was too sick to get out of bed to go to Mass. He was diagnosed with leukemia and given little chance for recovery. While he was hospitalized, on October 4th, Carlo’s website on the Eucharistic Miracles was unveiled. During his time at the hospital, Carlo made an impact on his doctors and chaplain. His doctors described him as having “sweet eyes” with a gaze “full of attention…of courage, of love, of strong empathy.” They said that “His faith in God, which he had wanted and still wanted to pass on to others, to his neighbor, shone through him … His gentle eyes … taught [them] a lot: life, whether short or long, must be lived intensely for oneself, but also and above all for others.” The chaplain who came to administer the sacraments saw in Carlo’s “serene” face a “composure and devotion” not often seen in dying patients, especially adolescents. After offering the pain of his illness to the pope and the Church, Carlo died on October 12, 2006. </p>

<p>Following his death, Carlo’s body was brought to his home and a crowd of strangers later gathered for his funeral. Carlo’s mother, Antonia, recounted how she had had a dream shortly after his funeral in which she was awakened by a voice that said, “Testament.” She searched through Carlo’s computer and found a video recorded by Carlo three months earlier in which he said “When I reach 70 kilos, I am destined to die” while smiling normally at the camera. Today, Carlo’s body is fully integral (not intact) and is publicly viewed in a church in the Italian city of Assisi, where he is wearing jeans, a track top, and Nike sneakers.</p>

    <h3><b>"Our goal must be infinite, not the finite. The infinite is our homeland. Heaven has been waiting for us forever" - Carlo Acutis</b></h3>
    <p>There are several steps on the path to sainthood in the Catholic Church. Carlo went through each of these steps and is now set to be canonized a saint. </p>

<p>In 2013, Carlo Acutis was declared to be a Servant of God for his exceptionally virtuous life sparkled with a deep love for the Eucharist and the Virgin Mary. This was the first step on the path to sainthood. </p>

<p>In 2018, Pope Francis declared Carlo to be Venerable for his heroically virtuous life of exceptionally high moral and spiritual caliber, filled with good actions and a close relationship with God. </p>

<p>The next step towards sainthood is beatification. To be declared Blessed, a thoroughly investigated miracle has to be attributed to the Venerable’s intercession. In Brazil, a woman named Luciana Vianna took her son Mattheus to a prayer service where he experienced this miracle. Mattheus had been born with a pancreatic defect that made eating so difficult that he always lived on an all-liquid diet. Prior to the prayer service, Vianna had prayed a novena (a nine-day period of prayer asking for a particular intention) asking for Carlo’s intercession to heal Mattheus. After the prayer service, Mattheus told his mother that he was healed and asked her for his first solid food meal of his life. A detailed investigation was conducted that included medical reports and ruled out natural or physiological factors, as well as correlated the intercession of Carlo to the miracle. Subsequently, Pope Francis confirmed the authenticity of the miracle and declared Carlo Acutis “Blessed”. Carlo’s beautification Mass was held on October 10th, 2020.</p> 

<p>The last step towards sainthood is the canonization itself, which requires a second well-documented miracle to be attributed to the Blessed’s intercession. The second miracle attributed to Carlo’s intercession took place in 2022, when a Costan Rican woman named Valeria fell off her bike,suffering a brain hemorrhage, and was given a low chance of survival. Her mother Lilliana prayed fervently for the intercession of Carlo to heal Valeria and visited his tomb. The same day, Valeria was able to breathe independently and walk with all evidence of the hemorrhage having disappeared. After another thorough investigation, Pope Francis approved the canonization of the first Millennial saint. Carlo’s canonization Mass is set to take place in the 2025 Summer Jubilee, in which he will become St. Carlo Acutis.</p>

    <h3><b>"All people are born as originals, but many die as photocopies" - Carlo Acutis</b></h3>
    <p>When we think of saints, we often think of unreachable characters whose level of devotion we never will be able to achieve. Despite this belief, sainthood is not an unreachable goal that only a select few can achieve. Rather, sainthood is something every person is called to by surrendering one's whole life to the One who loves us most. However, becoming a saint isn't easy! Being a saint isn't cool and won't get us the glory we might seek in the world. Instead, sainthood requires an elevation of the soul to offering everything we are and have to God. Carlo Acutis, the saint in sneakers, is the perfect example of this. Though he was only a young boy whose family was not religious, Carlo didn’t see these circumstances as obstacles to pursuing a holy life. He understood that the earth possesses no immovable obstacle to loving and pursuing Jesus; it only contains illusions of towering hurdles and tripping stones in our way to salvation. The devil actively works in the earth, creating these illusions that discourage us and entice us into choosing a temporary pleasure. </p>

<p>Carlo experienced the same temptations and challenges that teenagers go through today. Technology, peer pressure, and a challenge to the existence of God were all parts of the world that Carlo was sanctified in. Carlo was unafraid to speak boldly about his faith to those around him, not concerned with the way they would judge him. To avoid being distracted, Carlo limited himself to an hour a week to play video games. Carlo shows us that there is nothing inherently sinful in our leisure, but that it is actually something natural willed by God. However, Carlo understood that excessive indulgement in that leisure would distract him from God’s call. The example of the first gamer saint teaches us that virtue lies in the middle ground between both extremes. </p>

<p>Carlo's quote about our originality conveys the nature that God gave us at birth. Instead of conforming himself to new world developments like technology, Carlo chose to conform himself to God's will, preserving the beauty and originality that God created him in. When viewing Carlo's sainthood, we often might be tempted to see him in a two-dimensional view, using him as a champion for his worldly symbols like computers and the internet. Instead, we should fully explore the depths of Carlo's sanctity, understanding that his symbol is of "holiness in the ordinary" rather than the "ordinary in holiness."</p>
 

<p>Carlo understood that all of the world’s challenges could be flipped and turned into a tool to serve God. He used technology to build a website that promoted the most heavenly worldly thing: the Eucharist. Carlo wanted his website to get people off his website and into the beauty of God’s world. To Carlo, the Eucharist is a physical, tangible thing that connects us to Heaven.  Jesus didn’t institute the Eucharist to be merely a symbol that contains His spiritual presence. Rather, He instituted the Eucharist so that He could be with us until the end of time, humbling  Himself to take the accidental form of the bread and the wine. In the words of Timothy O'Malley,"[Carlo] saw in Eucharistic miracles an invitation for each person to see the world differently, to let a revolution of tenderness unfold in the heart of each recipient of this love. He did not stop at the miracles, employing them as debate points in online apologetics about true presence. Rather, he presented them as icons of Christ’s merciful love, of the presence of that redemption available to us on every altar of every parish church." Understanding of these mysteries is what brought Carlo to make a website dedicated to documenting the real and physical presence of Jesus in the Eucharist, spend many hours of his life praying face to face with Jesus, and attend daily Mass.</p>

<p>Carlo’s ordinary example shows us that sainthood is obtainable through a fervent love of the Eucharist and the Virgin Mary. Today’s youth shouldn’t feel discouraged by the developments of the modern world because they have powerful intercessors like Carlo in Heaven and the grace of God through the sacraments to guide them. After all, Carlo Acutis wasn’t afraid even of death, smiling as he prophesied his own impending death! God’s call to each teenager is to give up that which separates them from Him and take up his cross, following the example of soon-to-be Saint Carlo Acutis. Just imagine a world where you - the ordinary teenager reading at home - become a saint for the glory of Jesus Christ, your Savior!</p>
